                Opacities in Core-collapse supernovae</a><br>

                  Neutrinos radiate 99% of the energy and play a
                  crucial role in the explosion mechanism and
                nucleosynthesis of core-collapse supernovae. The
                neutrino interactions in hot and dense matter is a
                complex problem due to bound nuclei and the strong
                nuclear forces. In this work we calculate the dynamic
                and static response of the neutral current and charged
                current neutrino-nucleon interactions, from
                low-density region near the neutrino sphere to
                high-density region up to approximately 1.5 saturation
                densities at finite T, by applying random phase
                approximation (RPA). The consistency between an
                equation of state (EoS) and the neutrino opacity is
                guaranteed, by using density-dependent residual
                interactions, effective mass, single nucleon
                potentials directly derived from underlying EoSs in
                the RPA calculations. We further analyze the effect of
                EoSs on neutrino opacities by calculating the
                statistical uncertainties of neutrino opacities. The
                EoSs we used in this work naturally evolve to a
                model-independent virial EoS at low density, and are
                consistent with empirical constraints from (i) nuclear
                mass measurements, (ii) p-p scattering phase shifts,
                and (iii) neutron star observations. We found that our
                neutral current static response based on RPA is close
                to the results of model-independent virial
                approximation at low density, and the description of
                neutrino opacities at higher densities have large
                uncertainties due to still unclear strong (especially
                spin-dependent) nuclear forces.

                Previous studies have shown that the collapse and bounce of massive stellar cores is sensitive to electron-capture (EC)
                rates on nuclei near N=50. We have performed a large set of 1D supernova simulations using recently-updated rates in the
                N=50 region. By simulating to several seconds post-bounce, we are able to quantify the impact of different EC rate
                implementations on the long-term shock evolution, including the success or failure of explosion.

                    <td>Core-Collapse in 3D: Moving Beyond Spherically-Symmetric Single Stars<br>
                
                        The recent advent of multi-dimensional core-collapse simulations have transformed the supernovae schema. However, the
                        overwhelming majority of these new results are limited in that they rely on spherically-symmetric models of single-star
                        supernovae progenitors. Most stars reside in binaries and experience strong binary interactions in their lifetimes. Such
                        interactions significantly transform the progenitor profile on collapse, which alters the explosion probability and
                        subsequent diagnostics. Separately, including self-consistently multi-dimensional effects to capture the nature and
                        onset of turbulence in a pre-collapse model is of paramount importance. We report on one of the first self-consistent
                        modeling and explosion of binary-stripped stars as well as of the explosion outcome of three-dimensional progenitors,
                        taking advantage of recent groundbreaking work in this field. We find that binary stars lend themselves more handily to
                        explosion, as do progenitor models evolved in 3D prior to collapse, and explore the ramifications for post-explosions
                        diagnostics.

                    <td>Determining the Structure of Rotating Massive Stellar Cores with Gravitational Waves<br>
                
                        The gravitational wave (GW) signal resulting from stellar core collapse encodes a wealth of information about the
                        physical parameters of the progenitor star and the resulting core-collapse supernova (CCSN). This talk reviews recent
                        work that leverages over 30 multidimensional simulations of stellar core collapse using the FLASH code, yielding a new
                        analysis method to constrain the pre-collapse core compactness of the progenitor. Because the needed GW features occur
                        less than a second after core bounce, this analysis could allow astronomers to predict electromagnetic properties of a
                        resulting CCSN even before shock breakout. Likewise, this talk highlights recent additions to FLASH that account for
                        dynamically evolving spacetimes.

                        Observations of black hole and neutron star mergers in the era of multimessenger astronomy has enabled us to solve
                        several problems in physics. LIGO-Virgoâ€™s first observations of a binary neutron merger, GW170817, was also the first
                        ever event observed by both gravitational waves and light. Gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences encode
                        information about physical properties of the component objects---such as masses, spins, and tidal deformabilities---in
                        the source binary system. Measuring these parameters from neutron star merger observations can help us address several
                        long-standing questions such as---what is the nature of matter at highest densities in the observable universe? The
                        merger of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole typically leads to the formation of a post-merger
                        accretion disk. Outflows from such disks are a major source of r-process nuclei, fueling electromagnetic transients such
                        as kilonovae. With gravitational-wave detectors starting to sample the neutron star merger parameter space, it is
                        necessary to start producing models of the aftermath of mergers spanning the variety of neutron star binary populations.
                        This can be used to study engines triggering electromagnetic transients from future observations. This talk will review
                        what GW170817 has told us about properties of neutron stars and kilonova production after their merger. We will then
                        explore what future observations might tell us.

                    Traditional astrophysical hydrodynamics codes rely on operator /
                    Strang splitting to couple reactions and hydrodynamics. If the
                    reactions are vigorous, this coupling can breakdown. This can
                    especially be true if the reactions are evolved without an energy-like
                    equation. To enforce better coupling, we have developed a few
                    approaches based around the ideas of spectral deferred corrections
                    (SDC). For both Strang and SDC, we can encounter states that enter
                    NSE during integration, so we implemented a hybrid reaction network /
                    NSE method in the SDC framework. We discuss both the tradition method
                    and the new ""simplified-SDC"" approach and show test problems comparing
                    operator-splitting to the different SDC formulations and discuss the
                    implications to massive star evolution.

                When coupling large-scale hydrodynamics to micro-scale nuclear reactions in various astrophysics applications, solving
                the nuclear reaction equations is oftentimes the single most computationally expensive step in a simulation. This is
                because the nucleosynthesis of a reacting fluid is described by a set of stiff, coupled ODEs that generally requires
                multiple implicit integrations to solve. To reduce the computational expense of large-scale astrophysical simulations,
                we consider replacing the ODE solver with a neural network surrogate model. In this talk, we will describe our approach
                to building a neural network to capture nucleosynthesis and energy generation in a low Mach number astrophysical flame
                using simulation data from MAESTROeX. We will also present the current and future integration of neural networks into
                the AMReX framework as an alternative to numerical solvers.</td>

                Core-collapse supernova explosions (CCSN) are one possible fate of a massive star. Simulations of CCSNe rely on the
                properties of the massive star at core-collapse. As such, a critical component is the realization of realistic initial
                conditions. Multidimensional progenitor models can enable us to capture the chaotic nuclear shell burning occurring deep
                within the stellar interior. I will discuss ongoing efforts to progress our understanding of the nature of massive stars
                through next-generation hydrodynamic stellar models. In particular, I will present recent results of three-dimensional
                hydrodynamic massive star models evolved for the final 10 minutes before collapse. These recent results suggest that
                realistic 3D progenitor models can be favorable for obtaining robust models of CCSN explosions and are an important
                aspect of massive star explosions that must be taken into consideration.</td>
